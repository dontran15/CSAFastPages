<p>Our hope is to learn how to use Spring Boot as both a Desktop Application and Web Application tool. We also hope that the project we make will somewhat serve to be productive to us.</p>

<p>As a result, we’ve decided that if we go on with this project we’d make a web application related to studying and practicing for different school subjects. For now, we’ve decided math might be best because of how algorithmic it typically is. The first project we’ll plan on doing is creating a calculator with an interface to get used to using spring. Then we’ll hope to improve our calculator and also work on more comprehensive problem solving and how to help us study for math.</p>

<p>We may upload our previous code related to math and hopefully find ways to interface them with SpringBoot.</p>

<p>Although this is not a comprehensive plan of what we will or could do, we hope this post will serve as a baseline as to what we can do and may be able to use Spring Boot for. The most important thing is creating a project that we can all work on together as teammates while learning the intricacies of backend and to a small degree front end development.</p>

<p>Of course it’d be great if everyone could learn all the parts but delegating some roles would definitely help ease our work load and mark out clear responsibilities. We’re hoping to divide the work as so:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don: Spring Boot and MVC</li>
  <li>Krish: Calculator Functionality (parsing, functions, etc.)</li>
  <li>Nicky: Calculator Functionality (parsing, functions, etc.)</li>
  <li>Nathan: HTML/CSS, Calculator Functionality (compatibility with Spring Boot)</li>
</ul>
