A collection of my College Board tools and learning for CSA. It'll contain test prep notes, college board notes, and other resources for each unit up until the AP Exam. I'm so looking forward to this! :|

## Unit 1: Primitive Types

> Learn the fundamentals of Java, a programming language, as well as other foundational concepts for coding like primitives.

- [Primitives](https://dontran15.github.io/CSAFastPages/java/primitives/2022/08/23/primitives.html)

## Unit 2: Using Objects

> Explore reference data as a way to represent real-world objects in a digital world and discover methods to perform more complex operations.

## Unit 3: Boolean Expressions and If Statements

> Delve into the building blocks of algorithms and focus on using conditional statements to solve problems and control results.

## Unit 4: Iteration

> Learn about iteration, another building block of algorithms that are for repetition.

## Unit 5: Writing Classes

> Explore how real-world interactions can be expressed digitally by organizing behaviors and attributes into classes, and youâ€™ll examine the legal and ethical implications of computer programming.

## Unit 6: Array

> Learn techniques and standard algorithms to work with collections of related data, known as data structures.

## Unit 7: ArrayList

> Delve deeper into data sets, exploring ArrayList objects for larger amounts of data, as well as the privacy concerns related to personal data storage.

## Unit 8: 2D Array

> Branch out into 2D arrays and experiment with data sets represented in a table.

## Unit 9: Inheritance

> Learn how to manipulate programming without altering existing code by using subclasses to create a hierarchy.

## Unit 10: Recursion

> Work on solving larger problems by solving smaller, simpler versions of the same problem using recursive methods.
