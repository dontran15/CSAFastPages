## Unit 5: Writing Classes

> Explore how real-world interactions can be expressed digitally by organizing behaviors and attributes into classes, and youâ€™ll examine the legal and ethical implications of computer programming.

- [Writing Classes Presentation Example](https://dontran15.github.io/CSAFastPages/college%20board/week%209/2022/10/18/java-test.html)

## Unit 6: Array

> Learn techniques and standard algorithms to work with collections of related data, known as data structures.

## Unit 7: ArrayList

> Delve deeper into data sets, exploring ArrayList objects for larger amounts of data, as well as the privacy concerns related to personal data storage.

- [ArrayLists](https://dontran15.github.io/CSAFastPages/college%20board/pbl/week%207/2022/10/05/arraylists.html)

## Unit 8: 2D Array

> Branch out into 2D arrays and experiment with data sets represented in a table.

- [Iteration Through 2D Array](https://dontran15.github.io/CSAFastPages/college%20board/week%204/2022/09/15/iteration-mini-lab.html)
