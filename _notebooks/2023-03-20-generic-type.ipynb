    "## Hacks\n",
    "### College Board Classes and Objects\n",
    "As a part of OOP, classes and objects are fundamentals to the OOP paradigm serving as the building blocks. Essentially, classes are like blueprints and objects are just instances or constructions of that blue print. Classes have a lot of properties and in particular their most useful quality is gathering data and methods into a single place. Methods and data types can either only be called through an instantiation of the class or statically called from the class\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Access Modifiers\n",
    "Access modifiers indicate the level of access different classes/objects have over other classes and objects. Of the four most common types, there are:\n",
    "- private: only the object/class at hand can modify the object/class itself and cannot be called by sub classes or any other class.\n",
    "- protected: subclasses can modify/use methods and data from its super classes\n",
    "- default: default is the setting which enables the entire package (usually sub-classes) to access methods or data.\n",
    "- public: any thing can call the methods or access the data of public variables/functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constructor\n",
    "Constructors are the most important part of classes/objects since they dictate what happens to the object on the instantiation of the class. They usually ether take in parameters and set them data fields using those parameters, or run internal logic to set those parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modifiers\n",
    "Modifiers are special attachments to functions that dictate the use of that function. For instance static only enables the class to call upon functions/data. Finals prevents any other change from occurring at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getters/Setters\n",
    "Getters and setters are usually reserved for private fields and help access references of certain classes to both as implied get information and set information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Encapsulation\n",
    "Probably the most important part about classes and objects are the 4 pillars of OOP. Inheritance is the passing down of methods and data from a super class to sub classes. This helps organize objects as \"like\" each other. We see this particular in this weeks hacks with GenericType and Object classes. Polymorphism is the ability for multiple classes to have the same name implying same output for the same reason but perhaps a different implementation. Abstraction is the broader overview of classes where we want to limit the scope of certain classes as much as possible so that only the most important of their implementation is visible and usable. Finally, encapsulation is the \"wrapping\" of classes into single objects/classes.\n"
