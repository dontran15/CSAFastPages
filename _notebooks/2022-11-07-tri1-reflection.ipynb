    "## Overall Reflection/Takeaways\n",
    "Overall, there was a lot to takeaway from this trimester. Apart from covering mostly each of college board's 10 units for CSA and other general Java/OOP related topics, PBL covered a wide range of skills and tools that I was able to experience. The main issue for me was time management and separating college board and pbl into manageable parts. Often times I was all over the place w/ CS work. Nevertheless, there was a lot to learn that will both help with my CS knowledge and my future career.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Based Learning\n",
    "PBL was a really good experience especially in understanding what is necessary for full stack. Especially for web development, there was a lot to understand in developing websites and how to use and integrate databases and APIs into my websites. Beyond just web development, I think this trimester's PBL rly helped extend to other aspects of code development in terms of working with teams and employing similar concepts to other applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fastpages\n",
    "Learning Fastpages helped develop my ability to blog my learning and developments. Fastpages itself was generally very easy to use to develop requiring the creation of notebooks or html/md files. Generally, it seems to be a very useful tool that I can maybe even use in the future outside of CSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AWS\n",
    "Learning AWS enough to use it was a nightmare at first. It still is since many of the files and settings for the aws server wasn't created by me or a teammate. However, it was enough to know how docker creates an image of the code base from a github repo and then runs it on AWS's local machine before finally being managed by nginx as a web url. I also gained a better understanding of how to use linux commands and terminal in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Agile\n",
    "One of the things we learned was the agile programming philosophy. Overall it helped establish how to delegate tasks to other teammates and develop my ability to communicate and accomplish tasks with my teammates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTML/JS\n",
    "Although not a major focus, we learned some HTML and JS which was a decent exposure for me since I had little experience with web development. Having to deal with it however definitely gave me the opportunity to these two vital aspects of web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### College Board Learning\n",
    "This covered the 10 units for college board and although we didn't cover all the units, there were a decent amount of CS topics to takeaway.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods and Control\n",
    "Methods and control structures are important tools in building effective code. Not only do they manage the flow of code, they also enable efficient structures for code that can be reproduced for future instances of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Primitives\n",
    "Primitives are the most basic data types of Java and most other programming languages. Although they store small data, they are effective and can be casted to different data types. They are most easily processed by processors and are essential to most programs in a variety of ways."

    "#### Using Objects\n",
    "Objects are more complex data types and reflect the Object Oriented Programming paradigm which models the real world's use of objects except with code. It uses classes which are 'blue prints' for the code and then instantiates that class as an 'object'. At its core, it consists of attributes (data/variables) and methods. "
