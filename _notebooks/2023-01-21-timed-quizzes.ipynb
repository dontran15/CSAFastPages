    "### Overall Reflection\n",
    "Of the practices MCQs we did so far I found this one the most challenging and most time consuming. If I spent as much time as I wanted on it, I think I'd definitely be able to complete with almost a perfect score overall. Although 60/66 is not bad in any sense of the matter, I think a lot of them were less conceptual misunderstandings and more so mental exhaustion. I think if I practice doing continuos quizzes more that exhaustion will be better and I'll be able to analyze the code a lot better. I also spent well over 1.5 hours (although I did take breaks in between) but overall I think my total time on the reflection was around 2.5 hours of continuous answering them.\n",
