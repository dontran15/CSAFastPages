    "## Iteration Using 2D Arrays vs Iteration Using Objects\n",
    "Iteration is especially useful when going through long lists of items. Two instances of this could be iterating through a 2D Array which in this case is an array of an array of strings which allows me to create rows and columns for each of my ASCII art pieces, or a 1D array of Objects who's properties include a 1D array of strings that make up my ASCII art piece.\n",

    "Unlike the example in Mr. Mort's blog, I'll be using an aquarium and slightly edited version of the monkeys jumping on the bed rhyme and be putting them horizontally as opposed to vertically."

In this sense, the class has universal methods which can be called to do something to the objects it (the class) created. It's pretty crazy cool.\n",

However, OOP makes it far easier to manipulate the data of the fishes and the list that is iterated through."
