    "### Generic Objects\n",
    "One of the key concepts of object oriented programming is the idea that objects can inherit from one another. Thus, it stands to reason that you can have a generic type class that holds as many generic properties as possible that can be inherited and overridden by subsequent subclasses. Breaking these down we essentially get a tree of objects that inherit from one another or implement methods from one another.\n",
