    "## ArrayLists\n",
    "ArrayLists are containers (like arrays, lists, etc), which store data within them. Unlike traditional arrays, ArrayList sizes are not set and can be modified. In Java, they act as objects with their own special syntax. Instantiating an ArrayList is almost essentially the same with any other object where the user needs to call a constructor. In addition, Java's strong type makes lists, unlike in weak type languages like Python, all the same data type. Overall, ArrayLists are very useful, especially in the context of data bases, because they are expandable containers of data that we can access in a variety of different manners.\n",
