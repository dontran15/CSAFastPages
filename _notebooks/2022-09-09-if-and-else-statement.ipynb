    "## Booleans\n",
    "Beans? Leans? Loo Beans? Boo Leans? It's a Boolean! Booleans are one of the primitive data types that Java supports and are an integral data type to all of computer science. In fact, it's the idea of booleans that actually makes up an integral part of computers which we know as 0s and 1s (on or off) which in computer speak is called binary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Established by 19th century mathematician George Bool, booleans are at its core data for logic simply put in two types: true or false. With this you can create a complex structure of computing code and all other manners of code. \n",

    "Switch Case Statements help simplify/manage the complexity of if else statements which can in many circumstance become overly long especially when comparing by a case by case basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "It works by stating a variety of Case statements which all have conditions. The code blocks under each case are then run if the condition to one of the cases is met. Just like if else statements, Switch Case statements will go down each case to see if a conditon is met. If it is met, the case's block of code will run and ignore the rest of the Switch Case statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples below, the first will be a chain of If Else statements while the second example will use switch case to demonstrate how Switch Case statements simplify multiple If Else statements."
