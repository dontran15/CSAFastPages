    "### Question 19\n",
    "This one was an oopsie dasies by me, i clicked the wrong answer. Since x = 1, no matter what condition keeps the while loop true, x will only ever increase by 2 thus keeping it an odd number. So x%2 == 0 can't possibly occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 21\n",
    "The correct answer is A since each element is printed out through the for each loop causing the correct output of 123456. One thing I should do is look at all the answers before moving on since I clicked C given it was the first one I saw and looked alright to me lol.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 25\n",
    "Just needed to pay attention to code, I didn't realize the inner loop was starting at an index of y = x rather than just y = 0. If correctly thought out, the answer should be 10 since it's essentially summing all the numbers from 1 to 4."
