## Vectors vs. Scalars

### Vectors Quantities

Vectors quantities are, in the context of physics, quantifiable values that have a magnitude (quantifiable value) and direction that indicates its movment.

Examples include:

- velocity
- displacement
- weight
- acceleration
- force
- pressure
- momentum
- gravity
- drag
- etc.

### Scalar Quantities

Scalar quantities are, in the context of physics, quantifiable values that have only a magnitude without regard to direction but indicates movement.

Examples include:

- Distance
- Speed
- Energy
- Mass
- Density
- Power
- Length, Area, Volume
- Time
- Temperature
- Work
- etc.

### Summary/Concluding Thoughts

Vectors and Scalars are incredibly important values that I need to remember and distinguish between when dealing with physics.
